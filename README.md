Check it on web : https://tech-veda.web.app/

# Idea
The COVID19 pandemic outbreak has brought India into a critical situation. As we know the 2nd wave is approaching we have to fight the crisis with strict steps and with proper measures.Ant this has effected the education system badly so to make all education material at one place we have designed our solution TechVeda.

As you know during the COVID time the education system is unbalanced and students are not comfortable to study so here we are with our solution by integrating all the features at one place so that it's easy for students learn anything.

First the student need to login through the Google account then can see their dashboard and we have one channel section from which the student can subscribe and unsubscribe to any of  the others channel, Also one can create their channel by going through the option create channel.
students can ask their doubts by clicking the option doubts it's having two options one will show the stats of the students like what all  doubts asked, if at all student answered any ques, how many upvotes the student have and many more, and also the students can see the doubts asked of other students.
Also the one who have the channels can add a post and if any other student subscribe to the channel they will be able to see all subscription in channel section.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
